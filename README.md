## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- 


### What I learned

I learnt how Flexbox worked when applied on multiple parent and child divs, I found it really confusing at first but I got the hang of it after a while. I also learnt how to use the :hover and :active pseudo classes to change the background color of the button when it is hovered over or clicked on. I also learnt how to use the transform property to scale the image when the button is clicked on.


```css
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    .product-img {
      display: block;
    }
  
    .product-img-mobile {
      display: none;
    }
  }
```


### Continued development

I want to learn more about CSS in general, the different things possible and really move toward mastering it which then afterwards I will learn Jquery and React
